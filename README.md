# Diagnostic
8051 Training board diagnostic project written in Embedded C language
I write all the drivers totally individually.
Using the UART protocol I connect Serial Terminal for the I/O console and other protocols like SPI/I2C to communicate with the hardware.
Here hardware means EEPROM/ADC/LCD/GPIO pins Etc.
